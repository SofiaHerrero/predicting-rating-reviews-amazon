       "      <td>AMAZON ARE A JOKE TO TRY AND SELL ON...BEWARE OF THIS HAPPENING TO NEW SELLERS ON AMAZON.I honestly wish that I could give them 0 stars for how I have been treated by them..I opened an individual seller account, and listed some items - I clicked on items they had in their own product category and amended the staus for the ones I had. All seemed fine - then after only 2 days I find that Amazon has restricted my selling account as they think that some of the items are fraudulent - I would never sell items that were not genuine. Well my problem was that as I purchased items years ago so I could not supply an invoice within the past year, and inventory would therefore not match the listings, also asking for supply chain was absolutely ludicrous of them in my situation, being an individual who had bought items from lots of different places, and even some of the people I purchased from may not trade any more... As a result of this restriction, I did post one item which counted towards the £30 selling fee, leaving me owing £10 to them -- (me out of pocket for that game), but the other items that people had ordered had to be cancelled, seeing as though if Amazon would not pay me, then there was no way that I would send the items and hence be even more out of pocket myself.Their appeal process proved absolutely useless in my case and my selling privileges have been removed. I have tried on numerous occasions for some resolution to no avail.  I, therefore, am not going to pay them the £10 still owing to them for less than one day of being able to sell on their site.I THINK THEIR SERVICE ABSOLUTELY STINKS AND THIS ONLY HAPPENED DUE TO CLICKING ON PRODUCTS THEY HAD IN THEIR INVENTORY CATALOGUE - SO MUCH FOR MAKING THINGS SIMPLER TO LIST -- THEY HAVE SCREWED ME RIGHT OVER AND I REFUSE TO USE THEM EVER AGAIN = THEY HAVE NOW LOST SOMEONE WHO WOULD ALSO BUY FROM THEIR SITE TOO...PLEASE REPLY TO THIS IF YOU HAVE HAD SIMILAR EXPERIENCE TRYING TO SELL WITH THEM== MAYBE THEY NEED TO SORT OUT HOW THINGS LIKE THIS CAN HAPPEN.update 16th June 2018 - they have now had the audacity to take the £10.52 out of my bank so having to go to the bank to dispute it seeing as though they have not exactly done what they promised - I am formerly complaining to them, and thinking about using an ombudsman, or going to the papers.. :(</td>\n",

When i mentioned about it has gone down in price so they should give me the price advertise now, he said that the price advertised now is from the third party seller. So they will refund me and it will take 2 weeks before they can return my money. More frustrating because i wanted the laptop immediately that is why i paid for the fast delivery.

       "3     The customer service is terrible in Amazon.  I was having trouble with being charged from Amazon for no reason.  They claimed that I have the kindle membership and also the kindle music. I talked to the bank and disputed, but I got charges every month.  Then I called Amazon trying to resolve the issue, they are not very cooperative. I recommend anyone who has Amazon account to check if they are charged mysteriously from them.  Their stock price and revenue continue to be up, but I am question if it is because of the reason I just stated above. At the end, I gave up, I have to cancel my credit card and concluded it as a fraud to get my money back.  It is a terrible process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "4     I ordered 5 items on Sunday for delivery on Tuesday and Wednesday. An inflatable dinghy and accessories. The accessories arrived along with a drum kit, no dinghy, now I have an engine to attach to a bass drum, I doubt it will float! I sent Amazon feedback about the picture they send confirming delivery two days ago, no contact from them at all! On their website this morning, no way to contact someone, but I can return my dinghy if I wish! Chance would be a fine thing. Avoid dealing with this company, in theory the offering is good, but if you can mistake a dinghy for a drum kit, well enough said. I'll update if anyone bothers to contact me!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "8     I often buy on Amazon goods that I can't find anywhere else. Choice is amazing and I can (almost) always find what I am looking for. I make a couple of orders every month. During the years, only twice my packages were lost I have been refunded promptly. Another time I received an item (a t-shirt) with the wrong color, and again they promptly replaced it.Just be aware of shops when the sale and shipment is not handled exclusively by Amazon.

       "14    ★   from Amazon Customer on 21 June 2018  Amazon in Breach of Sale of Goods Act I bought a brand new HD Fire 8 Tablet. This item became faulty within a few weeks, but Amazon want to replace it for a second hand refurbished item. Amazon are refusing to provide a like for like brand new replacement or a refund! This is in breach of the Sale of Goods Act. I will therefore be reporting them to Trading Standards. The item is still under warranty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "15    Amazon has gone from a trusted company to a monopoly which does not care for its consumers.I had a package which showed as arrived but was unable to locate the package. I contacted Amazon after I gave the package another day to arrive, they suggested give it 72 more hours just to verify. Instead of attempting to figure out what is happening, the blame was shifted to me and the shipping company. They advised only if I am able to produce a police report will they be able to investigate further otherwise tough luck. After calling the police and my checking with my neighbors, no one saw anything and the police are not willing to help since there is no information to go off of. So now I am out my product and the money. This is unacceptable and I will not stop until every review site, the Better Business Bureau, and if need be my lawyer hear about this horrendous service by Amazon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "20    Used to be a great company, had superb customer service until recently. Items getting lost, wrong shipments, delayed delivery, which I can all somewhat tolerate, because of the great customer service that provide speedy resolution to all of those issues above. However, my last experience with the company was bad enough for me to write an review. I made a wrong order and tried to cancel. Contacted customer service on day one, was assured that when the item gets shipped out, I will be get my gift card credit back so I can immediate make another order. I was satisfied with what was promised to me as it felt like it was a reasonable resolution. Representative even said she'll personally ensure this to go through. Item shipped, didn't get my refund. Contacted customer service again and said refund will be issued within an hour. After an hour, no refund still. Contacted customer service the third time, and got told sorry you just have to wait, takes up to 24-48 hours for refund to go through. Supervisor refused to resolve this, despite the fact i've got similar situation resolved with instant refund. My main issue with Amazon's customer service is, don't promise me things that you cannot deliver, twice, and then tell me that's not how your policy works on the third time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "24    Very poor customer service for seller. It took me over two month to set up the business, customer service officers have no access to the problem, the seller verification team do not give contact number so can not communicate directly to them, they do not share information with Amazon customer service team either. During last 5 weeks, I rang them 15 times and opened 10 cases but very poor and vague response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "32    AMAZON ARE A JOKE TO TRY AND SELL ON...BEWARE OF THIS HAPPENING TO NEW SELLERS ON AMAZON.I honestly wish that I could give them 0 stars for how I have been treated by them..I opened an individual seller account, and listed some items - I clicked on items they had in their own product category and amended the staus for the ones I had. All seemed fine - then after only 2 days I find that Amazon has restricted my selling account as they think that some of the items are fraudulent - I would never sell items that were not genuine. Well my problem was that as I purchased items years ago so I could not supply an invoice within the past year, and inventory would therefore not match the listings, also asking for supply chain was absolutely ludicrous of them in my situation, being an individual who had bought items from lots of different places, and even some of the people I purchased from may not trade any more... As a result of this restriction, I did post one item which counted towards the £30 selling fee, leaving me owing £10 to them -- (me out of pocket for that game), but the other items that people had ordered had to be cancelled, seeing as though if Amazon would not pay me, then there was no way that I would send the items and hence be even more out of pocket myself.Their appeal process proved absolutely useless in my case and my selling privileges have been removed. I have tried on numerous occasions for some resolution to no avail.  I, therefore, am not going to pay them the £10 still owing to them for less than one day of being able to sell on their site.I THINK THEIR SERVICE ABSOLUTELY STINKS AND THIS ONLY HAPPENED DUE TO CLICKING ON PRODUCTS THEY HAD IN THEIR INVENTORY CATALOGUE - SO MUCH FOR MAKING THINGS SIMPLER TO LIST -- THEY HAVE SCREWED ME RIGHT OVER AND I REFUSE TO USE THEM EVER AGAIN = THEY HAVE NOW LOST SOMEONE WHO WOULD ALSO BUY FROM THEIR SITE TOO...PLEASE REPLY TO THIS IF YOU HAVE HAD SIMILAR EXPERIENCE TRYING TO SELL WITH THEM== MAYBE THEY NEED TO SORT OUT HOW THINGS LIKE THIS CAN HAPPEN.update 16th June 2018 - they have now had the audacity to take the £10.52 out of my bank so having to go to the bank to dispute it seeing as though they have not exactly done what they promised - I am formerly complaining to them, and thinking about using an ombudsman, or going to the papers.. :(   \n",

When my credit card offers me reward points, I generally take them as Amazon store credit because I know I'll find a use for it.Sometimes I almost feel bad for brick & mortar stores because it's often cheaper to order through Amazon than to get books even on sale.Would definitely recommend to others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "3391  Bought some stuff as gift for my friends in the US. I used my Ireland credit card and the gifts were delivered on time and in perfect condition!The fx rates aren't the best in the market (actually, they are a bit bad). So thats something you might want to look out for! Sometimes, it might be worth paying in your own the specific currency than in your own currency, as yopu bank might offer you a better rate.But I would definitelky deal with them again                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "3392  I order a notebook laptop. The delivery was very good i ordered it Thursday and it arrived Friday day but i paid for the service which was around £9. I was so disappointed when i open it because it was advertised as having a centrino processor but got the celeron. When i look at the website it has gone down in price from £390 to £377.I rang amazon, the man on the other line was very helpful he said he will investigate and will give me a replacement. When i mentioned about it has gone down in price so they should give me the price advertise now, he said that the price advertised now is from the third party seller. So they will refund me and it will take 2 weeks before they can return my money. More frustrating because i wanted the laptop immediately that is why i paid for the fast delivery. He arranged for it to be returned via DHL at first he said i should arrange the pick up myself but i insisted he should arrange it that very moment.I still have to wait when my money will be refunded.A very unsatisfied customer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "3393  I get most of my school books from Amazon, as well as electronics and other knick knacks. I love the free super saver shipping deal they have and they usually ship pretty fast. Amazon usually has pretty good deals on their items compared to other websites.  I have never had a problem with them!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "3394  I've ordered several things from Amazon from cheap camera lenses to books. The order always processes quickly and the item(s) always arrive earlier than they say (at least in my experience). The one time I had a problem was when I ordered a textbook from a new user (my/big mistake) and they refused to answer emails. I contacted Amazon and they issued me a refund after the estimated arrival time had passed. Just make sure you use trusted users!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "3395  Sometimes items arrive even faster than expected, always in good condition. I can always find the book I want.

       "3396  I've shopped with Amazon for years and always had great experiences when dealing directly with them.  Some years ago they started selling stuff for third-party retailers.  The few times I've tried the third-party listings never quite seemed up to the same standards as Amazon, so now I avoid them.  But so long as I deal directly with Amazon the experiences have always been great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

TIP: go into your account and find your order and then you can use that order to contact Amazon by online email.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "3406  awesome \"used\" sectionsI absolutely LOVE amazon! I have used their website for years, particularly for used books, movies and cds (both school-related and for fun). They often have great deals on their new items as well, making it more cost-effective to buy it brand new for a dollar or two more rather than a used copy. I have also used it to re-sell my old books. Whether as a buyer or seller, the customer service is great. I find using Amazon is MUCH more user-friendly than ebay or other comparable websites.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "3408  I ordered a razor off Amazon.com and within two days it was at my house. Amazing! Amazon lets you pay $80 per year and receive free two-day shipping on everything.

       "3409  I have had plenty of opportunities to shop on amazon.com over the past several months.  It has become one of my favorite sites to visit. I have purchased items directly sold by amazon.com and from other sellers on the site with great success.  Amazon.com is a very reliable seller, with quick shipping and excelent service.  I love their free shipping on certain items.  I had a large portable hammock shipped to me for FREE.  Love it!  It was a gift for my dad and he loves it too.  It's great quality and very easy to use.  I've had some complaints when purchasing through other sellers on the site for slow shipping but overall have been very satisfied and have never not received an item or received my pruchase damaged.

       "3417  I have placed an abundance of orders with Amazon during the last couple of years, none of which gave me any trouble. I have been in contact with customer support a couple of times when the delivery failed because of my own mistakes - in each of those cases Amazon was very friendly and the end result was always positive. Their web-page is perhaps the best among any retailers out there. There are a couple of negative points when shopping at Amazon from Denmark:* Most of the products are unavailable to danes* \"Supersaver\" shipping is never available* Amazon complies stringently with customs regulations which means you have to count in a customs fee that can sometimes be avoided with other online shopsI hope all of those points are going to be addressed in the future, with a danish or scandinavian Amazon.All in all though, one of the best shops online.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "32    amazon are a joke to try and sell on beware of this happen to new seller on amazon.i honestly wish that I could give them star for how I have be treat by them I open an individual seller account and list some item I click on item they have in their own product category and amend the staus for the one I have all seem fine then after only day I find that amazon have restrict my selling account as they think that some of the item be fraudulent I would never sell item that be not genuine well my problem be that as I purchase item year ago so I could not supply an invoice within the past year and inventory would therefore not match the listing also ask for supply chain be absolutely ludicrous of them in my situation be an individual who have buy item from lot of different place and even some of the people I purchase from may not trade any more as a result of this restriction I do post item which count towards the £ selling fee leave me owe £ to them me out of pocket for that game but the other item that people have order have to be cancel see as though if amazon would not pay me then there be no way that I would send the item and hence be even more out of pocket myself Their appeal process prove absolutely useless in my case and my selling privilege have be remove I have try on numerous occasion for some resolution to no avail I therefore be not go to pay them the £ still owe to them for less than day of be able to sell on their site I think their service absolutely stinks and this only happened due to clicking on product they have in their inventory catalogue so much for make thing simple to list they have screw me right over and I refuse to use them ever again = they have now lose someone who would also buy from their site too please reply to this if you have had similar experience try to sell with them== maybe they need to sort out how thing like this can happen.update 16th june they have now have the audacity to take the £ out of my bank so have to go to the bank to dispute it see as though they have not exactly do what they promise I be formerly complain to them and think about use an ombudsman or go to the paper   \n",

       "32    amazon are a joke to try and sell on amazon are a joke to try and sell on beware of this happen to new seller on amazon.i honestly wish that I could give them star for how I have be treat by them I open an individual seller account and list some item I click on item they have in their own product category and amend the staus for the one I have all seem fine then after only day I find that amazon have restrict my selling account as they think that some of the item be fraudulent I would never sell item that be not genuine well my problem be that as I purchase item year ago so I could not supply an invoice within the past year and inventory would therefore not match the listing also ask for supply chain be absolutely ludicrous of them in my situation be an individual who have buy item from lot of different place and even some of the people I purchase from may not trade any more as a result of this restriction I do post item which count towards the £ selling fee leave me owe £ to them me out of pocket for that game but the other item that people have order have to be cancel see as though if amazon would not pay me then there be no way that I would send the item and hence be even more out of pocket myself Their appeal process prove absolutely useless in my case and my selling privilege have be remove I have try on numerous occasion for some resolution to no avail I therefore be not go to pay them the £ still owe to them for less than day of be able to sell on their site I think their service absolutely stinks and this only happened due to clicking on product they have in their inventory catalogue so much for make thing simple to list they have screw me right over and I refuse to use them ever again = they have now lose someone who would also buy from their site too please reply to this if you have had similar experience try to sell with them== maybe they need to sort out how thing like this can happen.update 16th june they have now have the audacity to take the £ out of my bank so have to go to the bank to dispute it see as though they have not exactly do what they promise I be formerly complain to them and think about use an ombudsman or go to the paper  \n",

    "To extract features from the text we will use the common approach of bag-of-words. This takes into account the presence of words but not the order of them. The representation chosen are tf-idf vectors which discern better between relevant words and not relevant words by weighting them by their tf-idf. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data exploration showed how ideas or feelings where expressed in several words. To account for this and also to alleviate the fact that order is not taken into account, we could use bigrams and trigrams (apart from unigrams) so that expression such as \"not good\" are correctly captured. \n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter min_df for the tf-idf matrix which indicats the minimum number of documents in which a word needs to appear to consider it for the vocabulary, is set to a low number, such as 2, because the same idea can be expressed with different words such as 'great delivery' 'excellent shipping', and it is likely that not all users coincide in this. Therefore, a high min_df would be very strict for this task and leave features out. \n",

    "# Fixing imbalanced data and feature selection\n",
    "\n",
    "The main challenge in this classification task is to learn the imbalanced classes. Even though preprocessing helps to point out the relevant features of the text and improve performance, it is the imbalance issue what will determine the performance. The imbalance issue can be approached by either oversampling the minority classes or undersampling the majority class. The intuition for the latter is that it will lead to very few data points and thus, a drop in the performance, at least for the majority class. Therefore, we will try just one mehtod for it. For the former, it can be done by randomly sampling with replacement (ROS) from the data set or by creating artificial new examples using the neighbour data points (SMOTE). To find which approach is the best to alleviate the imbalance we perform cross-validation on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cross-validation also compares whether to use trigrams or no, apart from unigrmas and bigrams. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model chose is Support Vector Machines for classification. Given that it is a multi-class classification, the model train 5 classifiers, one per class, that classify one class vs. the rest. SVM is a very good model to deal with high-dimensional data and performs good for text classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "For this siutation with imbalance classes it is better to use the F1 score, precision and recall metrics. In this set up, it is likely that the classifier will try to assign the majority class label to all of the examples. If we only measure the accuracy we will not be able to spot this situation since the majority of the examples will be predicted correctly and accuracy will be high due to this. The F1 score, precision and recall are more expressive and measure more information. Precision measures from the examples predicted per class how many were correct. Recall measures from the number of examples from a class how many were classified correctly. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of both. Nevertheless, depending on the high-level goal of the classifier, i.e. the business case or application it will be used in, a different metric can be used for it."
